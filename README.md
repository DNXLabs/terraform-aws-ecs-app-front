[![Lint Status](https://github.com/DNXLabs/terraform-aws-ecs-app-front/workflows/Lint/badge.svg)](https://github.com/DNXLabs/terraform-aws-ecs-app-front/actions)
[![LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/github/license/DNXLabs/terraform-aws-ecs-app-front)](https://github.com/DNXLabs/terraform-aws-ecs-app-front/blob/master/LICENSE)

This terraform module is an AWS ECS Application Module (frontend component).

It's designed to be used with `DNXLabs/terraform-aws-ecs` (https://github.com/DNXLabs/terraform-aws-ecs). and `DNXLabs/terraform-aws-ecs-app` (https://github.com/DNXLabs/terraform-aws-ecs-app).

The following resources will be created:

 - Cloudwatch Metrics alarm - Provides a CloudWatch Metric Alarm resource.
 - Application Load Balancer (ALB) cloudfront key - Key generated by terraform-aws-ecs module to allow ALB connection from CloudFront
 - ALB Dns Name - ALB DNS Name that CloudFront will point as origin
 - Certificate Amazon Resource Name (ARN) - Certificate for this app to use in CloudFront (US), must cover hostname.
 - Cloudwatch Log Groups

In addition you have the option to create or not:

 - Cloudfront 500 Errors rate threshold
 - Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic United States (US) - Alarm topics to create and alert on metrics on US region
 - Cloudfront forward headers - Headers to forward to origin from CloudFront
 - Cloudfront Logging bucket - Bucket to store logs from app
 - Cloudfront origin keepalive timeout - The amount of time, in seconds, that CloudFront maintains an idle connection with a custom origin server before closing the connection. Valid values are from 1 to 60 seconds.
 - Cloudfront origin read timeout - The amount of time, in seconds, that CloudFront waits for a response from a custom origin. The value applies both to the time that CloudFront waits for an initial response and the time that CloudFront waits for each subsequent packet. Valid values are from 4 to 60 seconds.
 - Web Application Firewall (WAF) to attach to Cloudfront
 - IAM Certificate ID - Specifies IAM certificate id for CloudFront distribution
 - Minimum protocol version - The minimum version of the SSL protocol that you want CloudFront to use for HTTPS connections.
 - One of SSLv3, TLSv1, TLSv1_2016, TLSv1.1_2016 or TLSv1.2_2018. Default: TLSv1.2_2018.
 
> NOTE: If you are using a custom certificate (specified with acm_certificate_arn or iam_certificate_id),and have specified sni-only in ssl_support_method, TLSv1 or later must be specified.
If you have specified vip in ssl_support_method, only SSLv3 or TLSv1 can be specified.
If you have specified cloudfront_default_certificate, TLSv1 must be specified.
